# Acceptance Tests

You can run the test by executing in 2 ways

1) `npm run test:e2e --env <environment name - browser name> ex: dev-chrome | dev-firefox | dev-ie | qa-chrome | qa-firefox | qa-ie | prod-chrome | prod-firefox | prod-ie `
2) `node_modules/.bin/nightwatch --env <environment name - browser name> ex: dev-chrome | dev-firefox | dev-ie | qa-chrome | qa-firefox | qa-ie | prod-chrome | prod-firefox | prod-ie `

>Note: If no environment and browser name is specified, like running the command as "npm run test:e2e", then it will take the default settings i.e., chrome as default browser and localhost as default environment.
